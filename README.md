# Python Console-based Application :computer:

This project showcases a console-based system built with a deep-rooted understanding of the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. Alongside, the project taps into advanced Python functionalities such as file handling, logging, generators, and JSON data manipulation.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Features

- **OOP Design**: The codebase is rooted in the 4 pillars of OOP to ensure modularity and scalability.
- **File Handling & JSON Integration**: Efficiently manage data persistence for user information, book listings, and transactional records. Data can be saved to and loaded from JSON files.
- **Logging**: Keep track of events, transactions, and activities within the application.
- **Generators**: Efficient data handling, especially when dealing with large book listings.
